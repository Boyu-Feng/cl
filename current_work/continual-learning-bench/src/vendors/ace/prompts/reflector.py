# Enhanced Reflector prompt that outputs bullet tags
REFLECTOR_PROMPT = """You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose what went wrong in a model's attempt.

The attempt may be:
- a single predicted answer to a question, or
- a multi-turn trajectory with several actions before the final outcome.

**Instructions:**
- Carefully analyze the model's reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong
- Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the model's attempt with the ground truth to understand the gap
- Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies
- Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future
- Focus on the root cause, not just surface-level errors
- Be specific about what the model should have done differently
- You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook that's used by the generator to answer the question.
- You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral'] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)
- Return exactly one JSON object with no markdown, no code fences, and no surrounding prose

Your output should be a json object, which contains the following fields
  - reasoning: a brief summary of the diagnosis
  - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning?
  - root_cause_analysis: why did this error occur? What concept was misunderstood?
  - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead?
  - key_insight: what strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error?
  - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for each bulletpoint used by the generator




**Question or Episode Context:**

**Model's Reasoning Trace:**

**Model's Predicted Answer or Action Sequence:**
